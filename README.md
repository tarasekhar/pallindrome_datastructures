# pallindrome_datastructures
check if a given string is a pallindrome using LL
There will be a simple Linked List(LL) to which we will append characters
then we will check whether the set of characters entered form a pallindrome

we will do it by summing up the ASCII values of the characters on both sides of the mid-element
we will subtract both and check if it is zero, ergo, its a pallindrome.
